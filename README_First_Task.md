First Task:
I recently completed a project using the Titanic dataset to predict survival outcomes based on various features. 

Here's a brief overview of what I accomplished:

Data Processing:
I handled missing values in the 'Age' column and dropped the 'Cabin' column to simplify the dataset.
I encoded categorical features like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' using one-hot encoding to prepare for modeling.

Model Building:
I selected relevant features for my model, including 'Pclass', 'Sex_male', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', and 'Fare'.
The target variable I focused on was 'Survived'.
I split the data into training and test sets using train_test_split.
I utilized Logistic Regression as my classification model.

Model Evaluation:
I evaluated the model using accuracy score and a classification report.
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 81% on the test set!
I printed a detailed classification report showing precision, recall, 
and F1-score for both classes (survived and not survived).

Visualization:
I created a visualization showing survival rates by gender using Seaborn's countplot, 
highlighting the impact of gender on survival outcomes.

Third Task: 
Iris Flower Species Classification
====================================

Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning techniques. 
We use the classic Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, 
and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Data Exploration and Preparation

Data Loading:
Used Google Colab for the analysis
Imported the Iris dataset using pd.read_csv('IRIS.csv')
                  
Initial Data Inspection:
Viewed the first few rows with df_flower.head()
Checked dataset info using df_flower.info()

Descriptive Statistics:
Generated summary statistics with df_flower.describe()

Data Quality Check:
Verified for null values using df_flower.isnull()

Key Findings
The dataset contains 150 samples with 5 columns: 4 feature columns (float64) and 1 target column (object).
No missing values were found in the dataset.

Summary statistics reveal:
Sepal length ranges from 4.3 to 7.9 cm
Sepal width ranges from 2.0 to 4.4 cm
Petal length ranges from 1.0 to 6.9 cm
Petal width ranges from 0.1 to 2.5 cm

Next Steps
Visualize the data distribution and relationships between features
Split the data into training and testing sets
Implement and evaluate various classification algorithms
Fine-tune the best performing model
Create a prediction function for new Iris flower measurements

Code and Dependencies
The analysis is performed in a Jupyter notebook environment. Required libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib (for future visualizations)
scikit-learn (for model implementation)
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of loading, exploring, and preparing data for a machine learning classification task. 
The Iris dataset provides a clean and well-structured starting point for applying various classification algorithms.
