First Task:
Titanic Survival Prediction
====================================

Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. 
We utilize the Titanic dataset, which includes features such as passenger class, gender, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, 
number of parents/children aboard, and fare paid.

Data Exploration and Preparation:

Data Loading:
Used Google Colab for the analysis.
Imported the Titanic dataset using pd.read_csv('titanic.csv').

Initial Data Inspection:
Viewed the first few rows with df_titanic.head().
Checked dataset info using df_titanic.info().

Descriptive Statistics:
Generated summary statistics with df_titanic.describe().

Data Quality Check:
Verified for null values using df_titanic.isnull().sum().

Key Findings:

The dataset contains 891 samples with 12 columns: several feature columns and a target column indicating survival.
Missing values were found in the 'Age' and 'Cabin' columns.

Summary statistics reveal:
Age ranges from 0.42 to 80 years.
Fare ranges from 0 to 512.33.

Next Steps:

Handle missing values and encode categorical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Implement and evaluate various classification algorithms, such as logistic regression.
Fine-tune the best performing model.
Create a prediction function for new passenger data.

Code and Dependencies
The analysis is performed in a Google Colab environment. Required libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn (for model implementation)
matplotlib and seaborn (for visualizations)

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the process of loading, exploring, and preparing data for a machine learning classification task. 
The Titanic dataset serves as a valuable resource for applying various classification algorithms and understanding survival prediction.

Third Task: 
Iris Flower Species Classification
====================================

Project Overview:
This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning techniques. 
We use the classic Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, 
and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Data Exploration and Preparation:

Data Loading:
Used Google Colab for the analysis
Imported the Iris dataset using pd.read_csv('IRIS.csv')
                  
Initial Data Inspection:
Viewed the first few rows with df_flower.head()
Checked dataset info using df_flower.info()

Descriptive Statistics:
Generated summary statistics with df_flower.describe()

Data Quality Check:
Verified for null values using df_flower.isnull()

Key Findings:
The dataset contains 150 samples with 5 columns: 4 feature columns (float64) and 1 target column (object).
No missing values were found in the dataset.

Summary statistics reveal:
Sepal length ranges from 4.3 to 7.9 cm
Sepal width ranges from 2.0 to 4.4 cm
Petal length ranges from 1.0 to 6.9 cm
Petal width ranges from 0.1 to 2.5 cm

Next Steps:
Visualize the data distribution and relationships between features
Split the data into training and testing sets
Implement and evaluate various classification algorithms
Fine-tune the best performing model
Create a prediction function for new Iris flower measurements

Code and Dependencies:
The analysis is performed in a Google Colab environment. Required libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib (for future visualizations)
scikit-learn (for model implementation)

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the process of loading, exploring, and preparing data for a machine learning classification task. 
The Iris dataset provides a clean and well-structured starting point for applying various classification algorithms.
